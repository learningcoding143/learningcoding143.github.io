Licesnse Choice MIT

 I chose this license because it is widely used and easy for me to understand when I read it.
 I don't really think that other people could make money or use My Repository for anything that
 is not for educational and learning purposes. I am fine with other people doing whatever they want it. I like that
 this license protects me from any damage that this code may somehow cause. I would not be held responsible
 for anything other people do.
